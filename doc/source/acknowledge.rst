Acknowledging pyqz
====================

Only use lower case letters when mentioning pyqz, and always include the version number, e.g. pyqz 0.7.1 . 

pyqz will be described in detail in 

    **Vogt et al.**, in prep.

and the associated MAPPINGS V models in

    **Sutherland et al.**, in prep.

If you find pyqz useful for your research, please cite these references accordingly.

Additional references you may wish to cite as well include:

1) the article describing the new 3D diagnostic combining Ha, [NII], [SII]+, [OIII] and Hb:
