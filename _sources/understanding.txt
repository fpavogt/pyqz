Understanding pyqz
================
For a set of emission line fluxes and errors (from observed HII regions), ``pyqz`` measures the associated value of the oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) and ionization parameters log(Q), given a set of MAPPINGS simulations of HII regions. The code uses **flat(-ish)** emission line diagnostic grids to disentangle and interpolate the values of log(Q) and 12+log(O/H).  

As ``pyqz`` wraps around MAPPINGS simulations, it can provide estimates of the total abundance (``Tot[O]+12``) or the gas-phase abundance of the HII region (``gas[O]+12``). In the reminder of this document, whenever the former is used, it is understood that it is replaceable by the latter.

If you have read this doc from the start, you probably have ``pyqz`` installed on your machine by now, and managed to run the basic examples described in :ref:`runningpyqz`. But before you move on to process your own data, there are a few critical elements that you cannot ignore any longer.

A note on the pyqz syntax
------------------------------------------

The ``pyqz`` module is intimately linked to the MAPPINGS code. While both are stand alone and distinct programs, ``pyqz`` was designed to employ the same notation conventions than that of the MAPPINGS code for clarity, both from a user and programming perspective. 

These conventions, designed to maximise clarity while minimizing the overall character counts, are as follows:

* the ionization parameter is ``LogQ``
* the oxygen abundance is ``Tot[O]+12`` (total) or ``gas[O]+12`` (for the gas-phase)
* the Balmer lines from Hydrogen are ``Ha``, ``Hb``, etc ...
* forbidden lines are marked as ``[OIII]``, ``[NII]``, ``[SII]``, ``[OI]``, etc ...
* for the usual strong line doublets, when the doublet line fluxes are considered together (i.e. [OIII]5007 + 4959), a ``+`` is appended to the said emission line, e.g. ``[OIII]+``. By convention, the single line is always the strongest within the doublet. In short, ``[OIII]`` corresponds to [OIII]5007, ``[OIII]+`` corresponds to [OIII]5007+4959, ``[NII]`` corresponds to [NII]6584, ``[NII]+`` corresponds to [NII]6584+6548, etc ...

This syntax must be followed carefully when using ``pyqz``, or errors will arise.
 
The spirit of ``pyqz``
-------------------------

The pyqz module is composed of a core function: ``pyqz.interp_qz``. 
This function is responsible for interpolating the MAPPINGS IV grid of simulations of HII regions (using ``scipy.interpolate.griddata``) and returns the corresponding value of z or q for a given pair of line ratios. This function is basic, in that it does not propagate errors on its own. You feed it a pair of line ratio, it returns ``LogQ``, ``Tot[O]+12`` or ``gas[O]+12``, and that's it.

The function ``pyqz.get_global_qz`` is a wrapper around ``pyqz.interp_qz``. It is designed as a top interaction layer for the pyqz module, and can propagate errors or upper-limits on the line flux measurements. You feed it your measured line fluxes and associated errors, and it returns all the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` or ``gas[O]+12`` estimates and associated errors.

Yep, that's right: estimateS. What are these ? 

Direct estimates
""""""""""""""""

pyqz uses a well defined set of line ratio diagnostic grids (the list of which can be seen using ``pyqz.diagnostics.keys()``) to interpolate ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12``. Given a set of line fluxes, pyqz can therefore compute 1 estimate of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` per diagnostic diagram chosen by the user, e.g. ``[NII]/[SII]+;[OIII]/[SII]+``. These **direct estimates** (labelled with ``|LogQ`` and ``|Tot[O]+12`` for each diagnostic diagram, e.g. ``[NII]/[SII]+;[OIII]/[SII]+|LogQ``) are the most straightforward ones computed by ``pyqz``.

Of course, because all line ratio diagnostic grids are constructed from the same set of MAPPINGS simulations, all these individual direct estimates ought to be consistent, so that computing their mean value is a sensible thing to do. These **averaged direct estimates** are labelled ``<LogQ>``, ``<Tot[O]+12>``, etc É and the associated standard deviations are labelled ``std(LogQ)``, std(Tot[O]+12)``, etc É

KDE estimates
"""""""""""""

As we do not leave in a perfect world, some errors are usually associated with the measurement of line fluxes. The direct estimates do not take any errors into account - the **KDE estimates** (KDE = Kernel Density Estimation) do.

The idea is as follows. First, a set of ``srs`` (where ``srs=400`` is the default) random flux values (for each emission line) sampling the probability density function of each measurement is generated. Each of these ``srs`` pseudo-sets of line fluxes are fed through ``pyqz.interp_qz()``, which returns ``srs`` random estimates of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12``. ``pyqz`` then uses a Kernel Density Estimation tool to reconstruct a) the probability density function (PDF) in the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` plane for every single diagnostic grid selected by the user, and b) the full probability density function in the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` plane resulting from the combination of all ``srs`` estimates for all chosen diagnostic grids. Python users have the ability to pickle these (individual and global) reconstructed PDFs for external use (via the ``KDE_save_PDFs`` keyword). 

From the reconstructed probability density functions, pyqz computes the 0.61% (i.e. the 1-:math:sigma contour for a log normal distributions) level contour in the ``LogQ`` vs ``Tot[O]+12`` plane, with respect to the peak. ``pyqz`` subsequently returns as an (individual or global) KDE estimate the mean of the 0.61% contour and its associated half spatial extent along the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` directions.  

These KDE estimates are referred to (accordingly) using ``|LogQ{KDE}`` and ``|Tot[O]+12{KDE}`` for the individual diagnostic grids (e.g. ``[NII]/[SII]+;[OIII]/[SII]+|LogQ{KDE}`` with an error ``err([NII]/[SII]+;[OIII]/[SII]+|LogQ{KDE})``). The global KDE estimates are labelled as ``<LogQ{KDE}>`` and ``<Tot[O]+12>``, with associated errors ``err(LogQ{KDE})`` and ``err(Tot[O]+12{KDE})``.

At this point, things are most likely more confused than ever, and one may be wondering ...

.. _estimates:

What estimates of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` should one use ?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to this question. If all goes well (i.e. your measurements are reliable and have reasonable errors), the global KDE estimates (``<LogQ{KDE}>`` and ``<Tot[O]+12>``) are the values one should use: these combine all requested diagnostic grids estimates and observational errors down to one number. 

But many things can go wrong: one (or more) of your line fluxes might be unknowingly off, or perhaps the choice of MAPPINGS simulations is not quite appropriate for the HII regions one may be working with (in terms of pressure, abundances, structure, depletion, etc É), or perhaps real HII regions may simply not behave quite like MAPPINGS is predicting (sigh!). **In all those cases, one must use extreme caution with the global KDE estimates.** A lot of information lies in the individual estimates of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12``, and especially in bad cases. 

So, how does one identify the *good* cases from the *bad* cases ?

Comparing the averaged direct estimates (e.g. ``<LogQ>``) with the global KDE estimates (e.g. ``<LogQ{KDE}>``) is a good way to spot problem. For each set of line ratios fed to ``pyqz.get_global_qz()``, the code checks how similar those estimates are, and issues a flag if they are not. The possible flag values are as follows:
  - '9': the PDF is multipeaked. This indicates a likely mismatch between some of the diagnostic grids in their estimates of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12``.
  - '8': the observed set of line fluxes is located outside the valid region of one or more of the chosen diagnostic grids.
  - '-1': no KDE was computed (either ``srs`` was set to 0, or a line flux errors was set to 0).
  - '1-4': these flags are raised when the averaged direct estimates are offset by more than ``flag_level`` times their standard deviations, e.g.:
    * '1' <-> ``|<LogQ> - <LogQ{KDE}>|< std(LogQ)*flag_level``
    * '2' <-> ``|<LogQ> - <LogQ{KDE}>|< err(LogQ{KDE})*flag_level``
    * '3' <-> ``|<Tot[O]+12> - <Tot[O]+12{KDE}>|< std(Tot[O]+12)*flag_level``
    * '4' <-> ``|<Tot[O]+12> - <Tot[O]+12{KDE}>|< err(Tot[O]+12{KDE})*flag_level``


Looking at the flags can be helpful in identifying potentially problematic sets of line fluxes and (maybe?) the cause. Is one diagnostic grid estimates consistently ? Then maybe some errors in one of the line ratio measurements is not properly accounted for.

In the end, it remains to the user to decide which estimate(s) to use. The final choice will significantly depend on the intended usage, the importance given to the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` estimates in a subsequent analysis, and the ability to construct a precise model of the said HII region in the first place. 

**It cannot be stressed enough that choosing appropriate HII regions parameters (in terms of pressure, spatial structure, abundances, etc É) for the MAPPINGS simulations can and will influence the final estimates of ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12``, both individual and global ones**. If you are using ``pyqz``, chances are that you do not possess enough information to define these elements with certainty, and simply use the default diagnostic grids provided. This is fine. But in case of estimates mismatch, one must then keep this fact in mind.

Some pyqz parameters of particular interest
-------------------------------------------

* **srs**: the 'size of the random sample' of line fluxes generated by pyqz. This is used to propagate the probability density function associated with each line flux measurements. In other words, this is the number of discrete estimates of the probability density function (in the ``LogQ - Tot[O]+12`` plane) associated with one diagnostic grid. Hence, the joint probability function density function (combining N diagnostic grids) will be reconstructed via a Kernel Density Estimation routine from N x srs points. ``srs=400`` is the default value, and we suggest a ``srs=1000`` for errors at the 10%-15% level. Larger errors result in wider probability density peaks, and require more ``srs`` points to be properly discretized - at the cost of additional computation time of course  É 

* **KDE_method**: the Kernel Density Estimation routine used to reconstruct the individual and joint probability density functions in the ``LogQ - Tot[O]+12`` plane. Either ``gauss`` to use ``gaussian_kde`` from the ``scipy.stats`` module, or ``multiv`` to use ``KDEMultivariate`` from the ``statsmodels`` package. The former choice is 10-100x faster, but usually results in less accurate results if different diagnostics grid diagree. The underlying reason is that with ``gaussian_kde``, the kernel bandwidth cannot be explicitly set individually for the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` directions, so that the function tends to over-smooth the distribution. ``KDEMultivariate`` should be preferred as the bandwidth of the kernel is set individually for both the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` directions using Scott's rule, scaled by the standard deviation of the distribution along these directions. 

* **KDE_qz_sampling**: the sampling of the ``LogQ`` and ``Tot[O]+12`` plane, when reconstructing the individual and gloabl PDF. Set to ``101j`` by default (i.e. a grid with 101x101 = 10201 sampling nodes), datasets with small errors (<10%) might require twice this resolution for better results (i.e. ``KDE_qz_sampling=201j``).
