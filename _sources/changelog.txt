Changelog
==========

v0.7.0 August 2015, F.P.A. Vogt
 - added the function "refine_MVphotogrid", which uses Akima splines (in 1-D) to resample a given MAPPINGS grid.
 - updated code to allow the use of resampled MAPPINGS grid (or not)
 - updated plots to differentiate between "genuine" MAPPINGS points and resampled nodes

--------

v0.6.3 July-August 2015, F.P.A. Vogt
 - updated input files to MAPPINGS V files (csv created by Awk scripts, incl. Pk, kappa, sph/pp, ...)
 - added functions to check grids
 - started added proper warnings.warn and sys.exit('error message') 
 - implemented new MAPPINGS V terminology for line ratios
 - fixed several minor/less minor bugs
 - added auto-detection of wraps (not bullet-proof, but sufficient for the task at hand)
 - removed pre-defined "valid" grid regions in favor of auto-detection of the good regions
 - added flag ('9') for when multiple KDE peak (best value) exist 
	Note: 	
		- flag 1 => ('direct' mean -'KDE' mean)/ std 'direct' mean <= flag_level, for qz[0]
		- flag 2 => ('direct' mean - 'KDE' mean)/ std 'KDE' mean <= flag_level, for qz[0]
 		- flag 3 => ('direct' mean -'KDE' mean)/ std 'direct' mean <= flag_level, for qz[1]
		- flag 4 => ('direct' mean - 'KDE' mean)/ std 'KDE' mean <= flag_level, for qz[1]
		- flag 8 => the data lands outside of ALL the grids
		- flag 9 => multiple peak to the KDE map exist. Defaulted to highest peak.
 - updated diagrams design
 - started implementing 3-D diagnostics diagrams
 - added get_global_qz_ff, to feed the data in via CSV files
 - moved project to Github, consolidated the Sphinx Documentation as Github pages.
 
v0.6.2 December 2014, F.P.A. Vogt
  - removed the need for the global PYQZ_DIR variable  
v0.6.1 December 2014, F.P.A. Vogt
  - added number of srs points outside the grid (i.e. how reliable the final estimate is)
  - generate random point via truncated normal function to avoid creating negative fluxes
  - implemented upper limits (marked with flux errors = -1)
  - added decent documentation using the ``Sphinx`` module

v0.6.0 November 2014, F. Vogt
  - added proper support of the observational errors on the line fluxes. Done via propagation of probability density function and KDE reconstruction. KDE can be done via either the ``scipy`` package (fast) or the ``statsmodels`` package (very slow) but more accurate for multi-modal distributions.
  - updated saveplot/savefig commands in ``get_qz_ff`` for more freedom
  - added flag to output file when simple mean and advanced 'KDE' mean disagree by n sigmas
  - created new 'KDE' diagram of the q-z plane.
  - fixed output file header to avoid 'spaces' in column names

--------

v0.5.0 November 2013, F.P.A. Vogt
  - implemented a work around in get_qz, to ensure that savefig works fine also 
    with eps and pdf (note: the real issue is deep. In some cases (e.g. NII/SII 
    vs OIII/Hb, k=50), the original code would save different images in eps/pdf 
    or png ! It is linked to facecolor='none' in the path. Work-around: 
    facecolor='w', and zorder=0.
  - get_qzff can now handle files with only 1 spectrum properly
  - added savefig/plot/plot_loc/save_fmt keywords to get_qzff for better  
    control and ability to save figures
  - fixed a bug in get_qzff: the function can now handle 'extra' column 
    containing numbers and/or text

--------

v0.4.1, F. Vogt
  - fixed a wrong plot label for the [NII] line
v0.4, F. Vogt
  - fixed several bugs related with 2D input arrays
  - limited the number of bad points plotted to 1500 
    (for compatibility with grid_x and grid_y)
  - clarified the required input structure - must be numpy arrays (1D or 2D)
  - plots are now prettier, and more robust (defined via local rcParams)
  - added possibility to save plot via 'savefig' keyword
  - improved axis labels in the plots to make them 'publication-ready' (if one wanted to)

--------

v0.3.3, F. Vogt
  - now also displays the points landing outside the grid model with white 
    triangles (only for the 1-D array input type)
v0.3.2b, F. Vogt
  - corrected bug related to integer line ratios (e.g. [0],[0]) 
  - corrected bug related to the step checking if line ratios are on the MAPPINGS IV grid
v0.3.2, June 2013, F. Vogt (following suggestions by D. Nicholls)
  - added 'smart' plot limits (instead of fixed ones)
  - increased grid and data point size
  - added new keyword for choosing the plot window number (n_plot)
  - added 'if' statement to close the plot if all values are NaNs 
    (removed in v0.4)
  - added plot title
v0.3.1b, April 2013, F. Vogt
  - fixed indentation of 4 lines in get_qzff
v0.3.1 April 2013, F. Vogt
  - added .csv output for the get_qzff (or txt, which ever you like best)
  - changed header column of output files (only 'z' is used for consistency)
v0.3.0 April 2013, F.P.A. Vogt
  - added get_qzff function to directly work from a txt file
  - corrected get_pyqz for when points are 'on' the grid.
v0.2.0 April 2013, F.P.A. Vogt
 - modified fitting method to be 'slice-by-slice' for smoother results
 - added the get_grid function
 - added different readable areas for different grids and kappas
v0.1.0 Feb. 2013, F. Vogt
 - created
